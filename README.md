# FLAMES

The "FLAMES" application is a nostalgic game that many of us fondly remember playing during our school days. This web-based application has been developed using JavaScript logic and web pages, aiming to recreate the charm of the original game. In the game, players input their names, and the application uses its algorithm to determine the relationship between the two names, resulting in one of the "FLAMES" combinations. As you reminisce about those schoolyard memories, this digital adaptation adds a touch of modernity to the classic game.
